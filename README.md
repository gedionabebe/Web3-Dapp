# Web3-Dapp
## Certificate generation, Distribution, and Value transfer with Algorand NFTs and Smart contracts

## Overview
This project will build and end to end web3 dApp that let's a client issue None Fungible Tokens as certificates that will represent the successful completion of a weekly challenge to trainees, and allow trainees with NFTs to interact with a smart contract to perform pre-defined actions. We will use the Algorand Blockchain as the foundational element of the NFT. This will solve the challenge of ensuring the authenticity of certificates offer to trainees.
